# alien_invasion
A 2D game developed using python

## Pre-requisites
1. Python3 installed from the official website
2. Latest version of pygame installed

For macos users, it is recommended to install python from the official release package instead of using the default python3 that comes with macOs. There are some knows compatibility issues of pygame with macOs.

After downloading the official python3 package, install pygame through the command `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`

Start the game using the command `python3 alient_invasion.py`
